# Roids

This website lets users see the info of Near Earth Objects (mainly asteroids), using the [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/) Asteroids NeoWS. Users 
can see data such as magnitude, miss distance, etc of asteroids that are passing near Earth, starting from the current day till a week ahead.

Since I cannot make my own API key visible, I am using the DEMO_KEY, which has pretty limited usage. Hence, the demo site may often not show any data. This is what it looks like with the actual API key.
